# Week 1: Intro to ML Art & RunwayML
### Class Materials
- [Week 1 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/131HRgcWrVc-YWkdnYr0pRB4qvmejCbZ3JGk5mQqBmcA/edit?usp=sharing)
 
### Homework
0. [Play AI Dungeon!!](https://play.aidungeon.io/)
1. Explore the pre-trained models in Runway. [Playlist of demos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuCzxqIpJs8OOUUePUNVCHrCGDoKTtyn). Find a model to explore. In the class Slack tell us the following:
- What model you used
- What the inputs and outputs were
- What questions you have about the model
- Show us what you made.

Do this for at least three models.

2. Watch [this video on Colab.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7s-NKmOEpQ&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=ArtificialImages)

# Week 2: Intro to Google Colab
### Class Materials
- [Week 2 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ulXdHMcZgo3HSE9pd18xNo-PDbhn3a4sHc1OQHXIGo4/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Week 2 Recording](https://youtu.be/F8QR_mAE4Gw)
 
### Homework
1. If you want to train your own model, start assembling a dataset! You'll need 1000+ images. Eventually we will resize/crop them all to 1024 x 1024. So it's best if your source images resolution is higher than 1024px.

# Week 3: Datasets & Scraping
### Class Materials
- [Week 3 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UDx1JBOhqpK0wHrJor8QaoAujh2pTWGoTAxoFcrnPSY/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Week 3 Recording](https://youtu.be/nPi4tuW-YNs)

### Homework
1. Keep dataset collecting! You'll need 1000+ images. Eventually we will resize/crop them all to 1024 x 1024. So it's best if your source images resolution is higher than 1024px.

# Week 4: Training in RunwayML, IG Scraping
### Class Materials
- [Week 4 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MIvLQq0Z1VgN3GeFVu96sNCtCADI_k3cah0FNKZCo0o/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Week 4 Recording](https://youtu.be/yy9OCqZHYJY)

### Homework
1. Train a StyleGAN model in RunwayML.

# Week 5: Dataset-tools, Training in Colab
### Class Materials
- [Week 5 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15wIE0Rui4fLCfG-gL8lG_rEX2J-IPvRk9nAi8ieguF0/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Week 5 Recording](https://youtu.be/H_z4TU_5tp4)

### Homework
1. Train a StyleGAN model in Google Colab.
