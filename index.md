### Homework
0. [Play AI Dungeon!!](https://play.aidungeon.io/)
1. Explore the pre-trained models in Runway. [Playlist of demos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuCzxqIpJs8OOUUePUNVCHrCGDoKTtyn). Find a model to explore. In the class Slack tell us the following:
- What model you used
- What the inputs and outputs were
- What questions you have about the model
- Show us what you made.

Do this for at least three models.

2. Watch [this video on Colab.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7s-NKmOEpQ&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=ArtificialImages)

### Homework
1. If you want to train your own model, start assembling a dataset! You'll need 1000+ images. Eventually we will resize/crop them all to 1024 x 1024. So it's best if your source images resolution is higher than 1024px.
